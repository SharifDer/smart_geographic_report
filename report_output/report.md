## Methodology & Visualizations

### **Visualizations Required**

#### Interactive map: Top-ranked locations with scoring overlays

**File produced:** [candidates_map.html](report_output\maps\candidates_map.html)

_Note: interactive HTML maps require opening the listed .html files in a browser. If you want inline images, run with snapshots enabled on a machine with pyppeteer or selenium and a headless browser._

#### Demographic heatmap: Population density and target demographics

**File produced:** [demographics_heatmap.html](report_output\maps\demographics_heatmap.html)

---

#### Competition analysis map: Existing pharmacies with coverage areas

**File produced:** *(no competition file provided)*

---

### Methodology summary:
- Input: scoring JSON where each criterion overall_score is expected to be in the criterion weight units.
- Details: each detail metric is expected 0-100. We calculate detail weighted contribution as (detail/100) * criterion_weight for auditability.
- Validation: report flags detail values outside 0-100 and criterion overalls that exceed the criterion weight. See run_manifest.json for warnings.
- Aggregation: total_score = sum of criterion overall_score (weighted contributions provided by the scoring step).
- Ranking: by total_score (descending).

### Why this candidate is best
The top candidate `24.735048294067383,46.664703369140625` combines highest weighted contributions in traffic, demographics, complementary.

### Limitations & next steps
- Missing or "N/A" detail values were treated as neutral (not contributing).
- Phase 2 planned features: dynamic weight controls (UI), isochrone-based catchments, competitor auto-ingest, interactive sensitivity analysis.
