**Rationale:** Lower traffic speeds indicate better accessibility and parking availability.

### 👥 Demographics (30%)
**Data Source:** Demographic GeoJSON overlay  
**Method:** Spatial join analysis for age and income matching  
**Scoring:** Perfect score at target age Above 35; penalty of 5 points per year deviation  
**Rationale:** Target demographic alignment ensures market-product fit.

### 🏪 Competition (15%)
**Data Source:** POI analysis of Pharmacies shops  
**Method:** Competitive mapping within analysis radius  
**Scoring:** Perfect score for nearest phramacy is above 500m in living area; penalty of 10 points per excess competitor  
**Rationale:** Balanced competition validates demand while avoiding oversaturation.

### 🏥 Healthcare Ecosystem (20%)
**Data Source:** POI analysis of hospitals and dental clinics  
**Method:** Scoring based on proximity to nearby hospitals and dentists (≤1500m preferred)  
**Scoring:** Average of proximity scores; closer and more accessible healthcare improves score  
**Rationale:** A strong healthcare ecosystem increases site attractiveness and convenience for residents.

**Method:** Proximity-based scoring within 1000m; closer businesses improve accessibility  
**Scoring:** Average score across all complementary business types  
**Rationale:** Access to everyday amenities supports sustained foot traffic and customer satisfaction.

### 🧮 Final Score Calculation
**Formula:**  
`Final Score = (Traffic × 0.25) + (Demographics × 0.30) + (Competition × 0.15) + (Healthcare × 0.20) + (Complementary × 0.10)`  

**Range:** 0–100 scale where 100 = optimal conditions across all criteria  

**Interpretation:**  
- 🟢 ≥80 → Excellent potential  
- 🟡 60–79 → Good potential  
- 🔴 <60 → Requires careful consideration
